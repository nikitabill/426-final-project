# Love is in the Air

Hi! This website hosted on Netlify has my final COMP 426 project. Here's the hyperlink: https://love-is-in-426.netlify.app/

It includes: 
1) Login and account registration abilities
2) A game to assess how well you can guess two people's chemistry again the "Love Calculator" API (citation: https://rapidapi.com/ajith/api/love-calculator)
3) Several APIs and libraries including React, the "Love Calculator", Node.js, and Axios
4) Two key inspirations from great lessons throughout this spring (please scope!)

Links back to this GitHub documentation can be found in the upper banner, too.
